This app is titled Flickr Search App. When a user opens the app, they're presented with an open screen field along with a search bar at the bottom where they can input their key word for the search. After the initial screen when a user has tapped into the search function it will then display the necessary information about the key word into an image format and displayed into a table style arrangement. Also they can scroll  down to see the image in a more enlarge size, as you can see on the above images the sequences show you the process of how to get to each screen information from start to Finish.
